            At BrainHR, we focus on providing hands-on training to our

            sharing a keyboard and a computer. This approach enables candidates
            to learn from their peers and solve problems collaboratively. Team
            Programming involves working in a team environment with multiple
            developers, simulating a real-world project setting. This approach
            allows candidates to learn how to collaborate, communicate
            effectively, and handle different challenges that arise during a
            project's lifecycle.
          </p>
          <p>
            We provide Live Project scenarios to candidates to accustom with
            practical exposure to real-world projects. We provide candidates
            with the opportunity to work on live projects, from requirement
            gathering to project deployment. This approach helps candidates
            understand the project lifecycle and equips them with the necessary
            skills to be industry-ready even before they join a project. Our
            training programs also include sessions on soft skills,
            communication, and leadership development, which are essential for
            success in the IT industry. By combining practical training with
            soft skill development, we ensure that our candidates are
            well-rounded and ready to take on the challenges of the industry.

            The global e-learning market size is projected to reach USD 374.3
            billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 9.1% from 2021 to 2026 and 87%
            of organizations worldwide say their employeesâ€™ skills gaps are
            impacting business performance. This highlights the need for
            organizations to invest in training and development to bridge these
            gaps. In a survey conducted by Udemy, 60% of employees said they
            would stay longer at a company that invested in their career
            development. This shows that investing in employee training can
            increase retention rates. A report by McKinsey found that
            skill-building is seven times more effective than hiring for filling
            skill gaps. This shows that companies can benefit from upskilling
            their existing employees rather than hiring new ones and 67% of
            workers say that training and development opportunities are a very
            important factor in their decision to accept or reject a job offer.
            This highlights the importance of offering training programs to
            attract top talent.

            development to retain top talent. According to a study by Training

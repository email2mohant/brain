            BrainHR offers comprehensive DevOps services to its clients. Our
            DevOps toolset includes various software and tools like Jenkins,
            Artifactory, SonarQube, Checkmarx, GitHub, XLR, Chef, Splunk,
            Confluence, Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes, Cloud Foundry, Spring
            Framework, GIT, Maven, and advanced branching strategies. We work
            cross-functionally to provide automation frameworks and drive
            improvements in various areas such as patching, machine-managed
            certificates, security vulnerability management, and pipeline
            enforced test automation. We define and execute a program strategy
            to advance program-level CI/CD and infrastructure build automation
            capabilities, streamlining application release processes, and paving
            a path towards immutable compute.
          </p>

          <p>
            We use Git which is a version control system used for software
            development, Jenkins which is a popular automation server used for
            continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) tool used
            for automating the software build and deployment process, and Docker
            which is a containerization platform used for building and deploying
            applications. Our team of experts can also help businesses with
            DevOps integration and customization, using tools like Ansible which
            is a popular automation tool used for infrastructure provisioning
            and configuration management, and Kubernetes which is a popular
            container orchestration platform used for managing containerized
            applications.

            BrainHR provides DevOps services that primarily focus on cloud-based
            infrastructures and systems. The services include Azure services
            such as AD, Synapse, SQL databases, and PowerBI, among others, to
            create service principals that connect different resources. Azure AD
            is used to add users to different groups and provide access to
            certain resources. BrainHR also creates resources on Azure using
            Azure DevOps and manages repos and pipelines on different
            environments while creating new terraform scripts. Additionally, we
            manage and store new secrets, provide different levels of access
            policies to users, groups, and service principals on Azure Key
            vaults, and manage users, namespaces, nodes, and pods for different
            projects on Redhat Openshift.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, we manage releases, updates, and bug fixes with Dev and QA
            teams using AWS, Ansible, Git, Docker, and Kubernetes. We design the
            application layer of the product with EC2, RDS, and elastic cache,
            configure AWS cloud watch, and create cloud formation templates to
            deploy new infrastructure. BrainHR also migrates log data files from
            data center to AWS using Snowball and MigrationHub and sets up DNS
            using route53 on EC2 instances with specific DNS record types. We
            create IAM users, groups, and assign them custom policies and roles
            and configure firewall security groups on EC2s and Network Access
            Control list on VPCs.
          </p>
          <p>
            We automate backups on AWS using snapshots and automated backups
            scheduled using cron, creates elastic block storages to mount on
            EC2s to increase storage and performance, and uses Docker to
            containerize and deploy web applications for microservices. We
            create clusters, nodes, and pods using OpenShift and support the
            infrastructure, change management at infra level, and upgrade and
            patching major rollout OpenShift capacity planning. Furthermore,
            BrainHR uses Kubernetes to orchestrate the deployment, scaling, and
            management of Docker Containers, and sets up a NGINX web server on
            Kubernetes with a load balancer service for an external IP. We also
            perform vulnerability testing with nmap and other tools using
            Ansible and resolve issues.
          </p>
          <p>
            BrainHR utilizes Jenkins to deploy CI/CD and troubleshoot any
            failures through console logs, performs network troubleshooting
            related to TCP/IP, ethernet performance, NIC tuning, routing,
            subnets gateway, and monitors CPU, memory, physical disk, Hardware
            and Software RAID, multipath, file systems, and network using tools
            such as Nagios. We also create a bash script to monitor specific
            resources as in CPU, Memory, Swap Space, I/O stats and work with
            Docker for convenient environment setup for development and testing
            on Q/A, PROD. We provide DevOps support services including 24/7
            monitoring and management of DevOps systems and processes,
            troubleshooting and problem resolution, and continuous optimization

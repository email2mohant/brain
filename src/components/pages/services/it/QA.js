            BrainHR offers manual testing, automation testing, and quality
            assurance services. Our team has experience in testing complete
            Java-based web applications, configuring Selenium WebDriver, TestNG,
            Ant tool, and creating automation scripts in Java using JUnit prior
            to agile release. We automate test cases using Selenium WebDriver
            with TestNG, perform Restful Web Service testing using Http Client
            Java library, and execute test cases for functional, regression, and
            end-to-end testing. We also log defects in QC, execute regression
            testing, and develop and execute SQL queries to verify the proper
            insertion, deletion, and updates into the Oracle supporting tables
            and cubes.
          </p>
          <p>
            We perform functional testing to identify various critical points in
            the application and automated it by using Selenium WebDriver, and
            conduct backend testing using SQL queries to validate data for
            database editing and debugging tests using Cucumber. We have also
            worked with POM for the sake of code reusability, and have good
            experience on configuring the hubs and nodes while implementing
            parallel testing using Selenium grid.
          </p>
          <p>
            BrainHR performs manual and automation testing of web services,
            client server, and web-based applications in different domains using
            cucumber serenity BDD, postman, and CURL commands. We have hands-on
            experience in Quality Assurance including functional, system, smoke,
            regression, and integration testing, user acceptance test (UAT), and
            compatibility testing of web and client-server based applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have expertise in all phases of software testing life cycle
            (STLC), software development life cycle (SDLC), bug life cycle, and
            methods like waterfall and agile. We use various technical tools
            such as ParaSoft SOA test, Postman, and Splunk to test SOAP and REST
            services, perform data setup/testing, and analyze data. Our team
            also creates micro-rest services using Spring Boot and deploys them
            on Cloud Foundry Pivotal. We are familiar with source code
            management tools like Gitlab and Sitescope, and also use build tools
            like Ant, Maven, and Gradle.

            BrainHR uses several tools to automate the testing process. Selenium
            WebDriver is a popular tool used for automating web browsers, while
            Appium is used for testing mobile applications. TestComplete and
            Ranorex are other popular tools used for testing desktop and mobile
            applications. Katalon Studio is a complete automation solution that
            can be used for web, API, and mobile testing. The Robot Framework is
            a generic test automation framework that supports various scripting
            languages, including Python and Java. JMeter and LoadRunner are
            performance testing tools, while SoapUI and Postman are used for API
            testing.
          </p>

            BrainHR uses JUnit, TestNG, and NUnit popular testing frameworks for
            Java and .NET applications. Mockito, PowerMock, and EasyMock are
            mocking frameworks that can be used to simulate behavior and test
            code in isolation. We use WireMock as a web service testing tool
            that allows developers to simulate responses from a web service. We
            use RestAssured as a Java-based library that can be used for testing
            RESTful APIs, while Cucumber and Serenity are popular testing
            frameworks for behavior-driven development (BDD) in Java.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to automation testing, BrainHR also provides manual and
            automation testing services. HP Quality Center and IBM Rational
            Quality Manager are enterprise-level test management tools that can
            be used to manage manual and automated testing. TestRail is a
            web-based test management tool that can be used to track and manage
            test cases and results. JIRA and Zephyr are issue and project
            management tools that can be used to manage software testing
            projects. TFS (Team Foundation Server) and Visual Studio Test
            Professional are tools used for testing .NET applications. QTP/UFT
            and Rational Functional Tester are popular tools used for automated
            functional testing.

          </p>
          <p>
            BrainHR has experience in automating AWS environment creation and
            deployment using both CloudFormation and frameworks such as
            Terraform, as well as using Shell and Python Scripts to automate
            solutions. This allows for faster and more efficient deployment of
            resources, as well as easier management of those resources over
            time. We have experience deploying and managing applications and
            servers on AWS services such as Elastic Beanstalk, CloudWatch, IAM,
            S3, RDS, Elastic Cache, SNS, SQS, AMI and AWS SDKâ€™s. AWS
            CloudFormation allows users to define and manage AWS infrastructure
            as code, while Terraform is an open-source tool for building,
            changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently.
